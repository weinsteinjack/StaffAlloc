        "2. **Product Requirements Document**: `Artifacts/Documentation/prd.md`\n",
        "   - Comprehensive PRD with all major sections\n",
        "   - Executive summary, problem statement, user personas\n",
        "   - Functional and non-functional requirements\n",
        "   - Release plan and technical considerations\n",

        "- **Phase 4**: Create tests and perform security review\n",
        "- **Phase 5**: Build the React frontend\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Takeaways:\n",
        "- LLMs can transform vague ideas into structured, actionable requirements\n",
        "- JSON output enables automated processing and validation\n",
        "- Template-driven generation ensures consistency\n",
