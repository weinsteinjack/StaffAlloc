            "\n",
            "*   **Background and Role:**\n",
            "    Priya is a Senior Project Manager at a mid-sized government contracting firm. She has over 8 years of experience and is currently juggling two high-priority software development projects and one smaller cybersecurity assessment project. She is directly responsible for the delivery, timeline, and budget of these projects. Her teams are cross-functional, consisting of developers, cyber analysts, and scrum masters, each with specific LCATs and funded hour limits dictated by the contract.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Goals and Motivations:**\n",
            "    *   **Deliver on time and within budget:** Her primary goal is to ensure her projects are completed successfully without exceeding the allocated funds.\n",
            "    *   **Maintain a balanced team:** She wants to keep her team members engaged and productive without causing burnout.\n",
            "    *   **Provide accurate forecasts:** She needs to give her director clear, data-backed updates on project progress, budget burn rate, and potential staffing risks.\n",
            "    *   **Be agile:** She needs to quickly adjust the staffing plan when project priorities shift, an employee takes leave, or a new requirement is added.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Pain Points with Excel Spreadsheets:**\n",
            "    *   **Manual Calculation Overload:** She spends hours manually calculating FTE percentages for each employee, for each month, across three separate spreadsheets. She constantly worries about formula errors (`=Hours/Total_Hours_for_Month`).\n",
            "    *   **No Single Source of Truth:** To check if an employee is available, she has to open multiple files and manually cross-reference their allocations, which is slow and error-prone. She once double-booked a key engineer for two critical tasks.\n",
            "    *   **Hidden Over-allocations:** It's easy to miss that an employee's total allocated hours have exceeded their funded limit until it's too late. The lack of real-time validation has caused budget issues in the past.\n",
            "    *   **Version Control Nightmare:** Sharing the spreadsheet leads to confusion (`Staffing_Plan_v4_FINAL_PriyaEdits.xlsx`), and it's difficult to track who made what changes and when.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **What Priya Needs from StaffAlloc:**\n",
            "    *   **Centralized Project Hub:** A single place to create and manage all her projects, eliminating the need for multiple files.\n",
            "    *   **Automated Calculations:** A system that automatically computes FTE percentages and remaining funded hours in real-time as she allocates hours.\n",
            "    *   **Instant Validation:** Clear, immediate visual warnings if she tries to allocate more hours than an employee has funded, or if she exceeds their monthly capacity (e.g., allocating 200 hours in a 168-hour month).\n",
            "    *   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** An \"assistant\" that can recommend the best way to distribute a new team member's hours across the project timeline based on planned milestones.\n",
            "    *   **Quick Querying:** The ability to use the RAG chat to ask simple questions like, \"Show me the allocation for the Cyber team in Q4\" or \"Is Mark available for 40 hours in November?\"\n",

            "    *   **Strategic Planning:** Accurately forecast future staffing needs to justify new hires or training investments.\n",

            "    *   **Data Aggregation Hell:** He has to ask his PMs to send him their spreadsheets, which are all in slightly different formats. He then spends days trying to consolidate them into a single, high-level dashboard for his executive reports.\n",
            "    *   **Lack of Confidence in Data:** Because everything is manual, he knows the consolidated data is likely to contain errors, which undermines his confidence when presenting to leadership.\n",
            "    *   **No Forward-Looking Insight:** The spreadsheets show what's happening *now*, but they make it extremely difficult to model future scenarios or identify that he'll have a shortage of SW Engineers in six months.\n",
            "    *   **Inability to Drill Down:** If his summary report shows that the \"Developer\" LCAT is over budget, he can't easily click to see which specific project or employee is causing the overage. It requires a chain of emails and meetings to diagnose the problem.\n",

            "    *   **Drill-Down Capabilities:** The ability to go from the 30,000-foot portfolio view down to a specific project or even a single employee's allocation with just a few clicks.\n",
            "    *   **Predictive Analytics:** AI-driven insights that can forecast future resource crunches or surpluses (e.g., \"Warning: You will be at 150% capacity for the 'Cyber' role in Q1 of next year based on the current project pipeline.\").\n",
            "    *   **Standardized Reporting:** A single source of truth that provides consistent, reliable data for his reports to leadership, eliminating manual consolidation.\n",

            "    *   **Proactive Conflict Resolution:** Identify potential staffing conflicts (e.g., two PMs wanting the same specialist at the same time) before they become critical issues.\n",

            "    *   **Smart Search and Filtering:** The ability to query the system with complex requests like, \"Show me all LCAT-3 SW Engineers with less than 75% FTE in October.\"\n",

            "StaffAlloc is an intelligent, AI-powered staffing management application designed to replace cumbersome and error-prone spreadsheets. It provides project managers, directors, and resource managers with a centralized platform to create projects, allocate employee hours, track budgets, and optimize resource utilization across the entire organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Purpose\n",
            "The primary purpose of StaffAlloc is to solve the critical business challenges of manual resource planning. By automating calculations, providing real-time validation, and offering AI-driven insights, StaffAlloc empowers organizations to make faster, data-driven staffing decisions. This leads to improved project outcomes, increased financial efficiency, and a more balanced workload for employees.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Vision\n",
            "Our vision is to transform resource management from a reactive, administrative chore into a proactive, strategic function. StaffAlloc will become the single source of truth for \"who is working on what, when, and for how long,\" enabling organizations to perfectly align their talent with their strategic objectives and anticipate future needs before they arise.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Problem Statement\n",
            "Organizations rely on a fragmented system of spreadsheets to manage project staffing and resource allocation. This manual process is inefficient, prone to costly errors, and lacks real-time visibility. Project managers struggle to prevent budget overruns and employee burnout, while leadership lacks the consolidated data needed for strategic forecasting and decision-making. There is no effective way to see cross-project dependencies, identify available talent quickly, or optimize the deployment of the company's most valuable asset: its people.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **Priya, the Hands-On PM:** Spends hours each week in spreadsheets manually calculating FTEs and tracking funded hours. She constantly worries about formula errors and has accidentally double-booked key employees because she lacks a unified view of their commitments. She needs a tool that automates the math and provides instant warnings to keep her projects on track and on budget.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **David, the Portfolio Overseer:** Is accountable for the financial health and utilization of his entire division but has no easy way to get a consolidated view. He spends days aggregating data from multiple PMs' spreadsheets for his executive reports, and he lacks confidence in the data's accuracy. He needs a real-time dashboard to monitor portfolio health, mitigate risks, and forecast future hiring needs.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Maria, the Utilization Optimizer:** Is responsible for ensuring employees are effectively and equitably utilized across the company. The siloed nature of spreadsheets makes it impossible for her to see who is overworked, who is on the bench, or who has the right skills and availability for a new project. She operates in a constant state of reactive firefighting and needs a global, unified view to proactively manage the company's talent pool.\n",
