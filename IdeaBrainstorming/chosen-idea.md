**TripSplit: Group Travel Expense Manager**

**Description:** A collaborative expense tracking application specifically designed for group travel. Travelers can create trips, add participants, log expenses, and automatically calculate who owes whom at the end of the trip.

**Core Features:**
- Create and manage trips with multiple participants
- Add expenses with category, amount, payer, and split method (equal, percentage, custom)
- View real-time balance summary showing who owes whom
- Generate settlement recommendations (minimize number of transactions)
- Export expense reports

**Why This Works:**
- Clear CRUD operations (Trips, Participants, Expenses, Settlements)
- Natural database relationships (many-to-many)
- Simple but useful UI (forms, lists, summary dashboard)
- Real-world problem many can relate to

**Extension Possibilities (Bonus):**
- RAG: Chat interface to query expenses ("How much did we spend on food?")
- Agent: Smart categorization of expenses using AI
- Receipt photo upload and OCR parsing
- Currency conversion integration
- Split by item (restaurant bills)
